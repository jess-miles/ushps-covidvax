    "> <font size=2em>The Data Science Process we'll be using during this section--OSEMiN (pronounced \"OH-sum\", rhymes with \"possum\").  This is the most straightforward of the Data Science Processes discussed so far.  **Note that during this process, just like the others, the stages often blur together.***  It is completely acceptable (and ***often a best practice!) to float back and forth** between stages as you learn new things about your problem, dataset, requirements, etc.  \n",
    "It's quite common to get to the modeling step and realize that you need to scrub your data a bit more or engineer a different feature and jump back to the \"Scrub\" stage, or go all the way back to the \"Obtain\" stage when you realize your current data isn't sufficient to solve this problem. \n",
    "As with any of these frameworks, *OSEMiN is meant to be treated as guidelines, not law. \n",

    "- This step involves understanding stakeholder requirements, gathering information on the problem, and finally sourcing data that we think will be necessary for solving this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "**SCRUB**\n",
    "\n",
    "- During this stage, we'll focus on preprocessing our data.  Important steps such as identifying and removing null values, dealing with outliers, normalizing data, and feature engineering/feature selection are handled around this stage.  The line with this stage really blurs with the _Explore_ stage, as it is common to only realize that certain columns require cleaning or preprocessing as a result of the visualzations and explorations done during Step 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that although technically, categorical data should be one-hot encoded during this step, in practice, it's usually done after data exploration.  This is because it is much less time-consuming to visualize and explore a few columns containing categorical data than it is to explore many different dummy columns that have been one-hot encoded. \n",
    "\n",
    "**EXPLORE**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This step focuses on getting to know the dataset you're working with. As mentioned above, this step tends to blend with the _Scrub_ step mentioned above.  During this step, you'll create visualizations to really get a feel for your dataset.  You'll focus on things such as understanding the distribution of different columns, checking for multicollinearity, and other tasks liek that.  If your project is a classification task, you may check the balance of the different classes in your dataset.  If your problem is a regression task, you may check that the dataset meets the assumptions necessary for a regression task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- At the end of this step, you should have a dataset ready for modeling that you've thoroughly explored and are extremely familiar with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**MODEL**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This step, as with the last two frameworks, is also pretty self-explanatory. It consists of building and tuning models using all the tools you have in your data science toolbox.  In practice, this often means defining a threshold for success, selecting machine learning algorithms to test on the project, and tuning the ones that show promise to try and increase your results.  As with the other stages, it is both common and accepted to realize something, jump back to a previous stage like _Scrub_ or _Explore_, and make some changes to see how it affects the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**iNTERPRET**\n",
    "\n",
    "- During this step, you'll interpret the results of your model(s), and communicate results to stakeholders.  As with the other frameworks, communication is incredibily important! During this stage, you may come to realize that further investigation is needed, or more data.  That's totally fine--figure out what's needed, go get it, and start the process over! If your results are satisfactory to all stakeholders involved, you may also go from this stage right into productionizing your model and automating processes necessary to support it.  \n",

    "COVID-19 vaccines became available to subsets of the American public at the end of 2020. States and cities differed in terms of which groups of people were eligible first, and the timeline by which they expanded eligibility, but [by April 19th](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/world/adults-eligible-covid-vaccine.html), all Americans over the age of 16 were eligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Appointment availability was initially scarce in some places, but this very quickly shifted to a growing number of appointments going unfilled across the country. [Only 59% of adults have received at least one dose](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home) (as of this writing, on May 14th, 2021), so there are still plenty of people who haven't received any doses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaccination rate is an important metric being considered as state and local governments decide how and when to relax mask-wearing, occupancy, and other COVID restrictions. These entities are already wondering about the best methods to encourage their populations to get vaccinated. In order to develop effective strategies, state and local governments need to understand the factors that contribute to vaccine hesitancy. \n",
    "\n",
    "To aid in this understanding, I will build a predictive model to classify whether someone is likely to be vaccine optimistic, or vaccine hesitant, based on their other answers to the Household Pulse Survey that the US Census has been conducting bi-weekly during the pandemic. Interpreting the factors which are most important in predicting vaccine hesitancy among populations should provide insights that will allow state and local governments to develop effective outreach strategies.\n",

    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, I will use a [publicly available microdata sample](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html) from the bi-weekly Household Pulse Surveys that the US Census has been conducting during the pandemic. Each observation represents an individual's anonymized response to the survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Respondents were randomly sampled from all 50 states and the top 15 metropolitan areas, and asked to fill out the survey online. They were asked a variety of questions about their household, including whether they've received any doses of the vaccine, and if not, what their intent was to do so in the future. I will engineer these features into a binary target variable representing vaccine optimism versus vaccine hesitancy, and use each respondent's answers to other survey questions as the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some survey questions were only presented to the respondent if they answered a certain way to a prior question, such as only asking about intention to get a vaccine in the future if the respondent indicated they had not yet received any doses. I will carefully review the data dictionary provided by the Census team to understand these relationships, and  engineer features from the groups of questions as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use the most recent microdata file available as of this writing, May 14, 2021, which includes a sample of about 78,000 responses from Phase 3 of the survey, covering the timeframe of March 3 to March 15, 2021. This is referred to as the \"week 26\" period.  Note that the survey is ongoing and currently in Phase 3.1, but microdata is not yet available for the first week of Phase 3.1, so I will use the most recent data available.\n",

I looked back and realized I had combined mobile home with boat/RV/van because both were somewhat rare features. Given how large of a target mean difference I saw, I went back and re-engineered that feature earlier in the notebook to keep them separate, so that 1 = mobile home, and 4 = boat/RV/van.\n",

    "- `SPNDSRC8` value of 1 has a much higher target mean than the population. Looking at that question, it's related to whether the respondent used SNAP funds in the past 7 days. Since I already have a column to indicate SNAP participation, I'll drop this column.\n",
